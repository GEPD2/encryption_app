# Cryptography Toolbox üîê

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8+-blue)
![Kivy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kivy-2.0+-green)

A multi-algorithm encryption and hashing GUI application built with Python and Kivy, featuring classical ciphers and modern cryptographic hashes.
There are 2 .py file one is an older version made in python and kivy labuage and the other file is written in pure python.
All the next update and the upcoming algorithms that are on the way will be applied only to the pure python file!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Classical Ciphers**:
  - Caesar cipher encryption/decryption
  - Affine cipher encryption/decryption
  - Vigen√®re cipher encryption/decryption
- **Cryptographic Hashes**:
  - MD5 hashing
  - SHA-512 hashing
- **File Operations**:
  - Hash file contents
  - Compare file hashes
  - Store hashes to new files
- **Analysis Tools**:
  - Frequency analysis visualization
  - Hash verification

## Cryptographic Components üß©

### üîê Encryption Algorithms

| Algorithm  | Key Requirements             | Notes                          | Security Level |
|------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Caesar** | Single integer (1-25)        | Only alphabetic characters     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low         |
| **Affine** | Two integers (a, b)          | 'a' must be coprime with 26    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low         |
| **Vigen√®re**| Text key (case-sensitive)    | Polyalphabetic substitution    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium-Low  |

> **Note**: These classical ciphers are for educational purposes only. Not secure for modern cryptographic needs.

### üîç Hash Functions

| Function   | Output Size | Collision Resistance | Speed | Common Uses |
|------------|------------|----------------------|-------|-------------|
| **MD5**    | 128-bit    | ‚ùå Broken            | ‚ö° Fast | File integrity checks, checksums |
| **SHA-512**| 512-bit    | ‚úÖ Strong            | ‚è≥ Slow | Secure password storage, digital signatures |

> **Security Advisory**: MD5 should not be used for security-sensitive applications.

Security Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
Important:

Classical ciphers (Caesar, Affine, Vigen√®re) are not secure for modern cryptographic needs

MD5 is considered broken for security purposes

Use SHA-512 for cryptographic applications
