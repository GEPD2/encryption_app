# encryption_app
encryption app written in python (algorithms used for encryption, caesar,affine,vigener,MD5,SHA256)
already made caesar encryption and decryption,also there is frequency analysis almost everywhere,affine encryption and decryption,vigener encryption and md5 encryption.
for the moment an isssue occures when reading the files,it's in the proccess to be fixed.
add photos to a directory named images (it must in the same directory where the .py file is)
the name of photos will be g1 g2 g12 g13 g14 g15 g16 and etc (see for the moment in the code the names) and then it will run smoothly.
