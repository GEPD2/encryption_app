If you use Linux if not all,but most of them already have python install but for some reason if you uninstalled it in order to reinstall it open
your terminal and type: sudo apt install python
If you use windows 11 or 10 go to python.org and download any version you like from there then open the .exe file you downloaded
once you open it continue the installation process and give admin privillage in order to create the variables for your computer
else do it manually by onpening and adding the variables there
